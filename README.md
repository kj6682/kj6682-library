==============

my library

This project is used as a learning experience to leverage Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, JS for rich content clients
..and whatever I want to include to have fun

There are several modules (by now)

parent - the parent itself
main - the hosting SpringBoot application 
store - the managed store for instances (books, dvd, papers such as references) to be browsed or borrowed to users
catalog - the detailed catalog for the contents
register - to keep track of the users

have fun
